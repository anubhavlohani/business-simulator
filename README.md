# Business Simulation

This guide will help you run this project locally. Before starting, make sure git is installed.

## Step 1

Make sure nodejs is installed on your machine. To check, type the following command into your command prompt (cmd):

```
node -v
```

If the output is a version, nodejs is installed and you can proceed to step 2. If not, install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v21.7 is recommended).

## Step 2

Open command prompt once again and navigate to where you want to create the project folder. If you want to create it on desktop, simply type `cd Desktop` after you open cmd. Once that's done, paste the following command into cmd:

```
git clone https://github.com/anubhavlohani/business-simulator.git
```

## Step 3

Move into the project folder `cd business-simulator`. Once inside, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation finishes run:

```
npm run dev
```

Now you will be able to use the app by visiting http://localhost:5173/ from your browser.
